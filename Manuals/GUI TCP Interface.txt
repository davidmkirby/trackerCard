TCP/IP GUI Control
==================

TCP connection to port 10000

Commands and responses are CRLF terminated ASCII strings.
Commands are case insensitive.
All commands will receive a response.
Responses to command are either OK or Error:<reason>.
Responses to queries are returned in the same format as the command.

Commands
========

Log:File:<filename>
  Sets the log file name.

Log:File:?
  Returns the current log file name.

Log:Desc:<description string>
  Sets the log file description string.

Log:Desc:?
  Returns the current log file description string.

Log:Open
  Opens the current log file.  This will erase any data current in the file and start a new file.

Log:Close
  Closes and flushes the log file disk.

Log:?
  Returns the current status of the log file ("Log:Open" or "Log:Closed")

Log:Enable:On
  Enable logging to disk.  You must set the successful open the log file before this command.

Log:Enable:Off
  Disable logging to disk.  This does not close the log file, it just suspends data logging.

Log:Enable:?
  Returns the on/off status of logging ("Log:Enable:On" or "Log:Enable:Off")


Mount:Pos:<azimuth> <elevation> <azimuth velocity> <elevation velocity>
  Drives the mount to the specified azimuth and elevation position in degrees at the specified
  maximum velocity in degress per second (example: "Mount:Pos:-10.234 170.122 10.000 8.000")
  
Mount:PosTrk:<azimuth> <elevation> <azimuth velocity> <elevation velocity>
  Drives the mount at a given rate (position mode tracking) to the specified azimuth and elevation
  position in degrees.  Some mounts also support a velocity in degress per second which can be
  a rate limit or similar.  Some mounts require the velocities to be set to zero.
  (example: "Mount:PosTrk:-10.234 170.122 0 0")

Mount:Pos:?
  Returns the current mount azimuth and elevation position in degrees and target range in meters (if valid)
  (example: "Mount:Pos:-10.234 170.122" or "Mount:Pos:-10.234 170.122 100.50")

Mount:Offsets:<azimuth offset> <elevation offset> 
  Sets the mount azimuth and elevation position offsets in degrees.  Typically used to set
  the azimuth offset for true/magnetic North correction.
  (example: "Mount:Offsets:-5.623 0.0")


AutoTrack:On
  Enable auto-track.
  
AutoTrack:Off
  Disable auto-track.
  
AutoTrack:?
  Returns the current state of the auto-track function ("AutoTrack:On" or "AutoTrack:Off")


AutoAcquire:On
  Enable auto-acquire.
  
AutoAcquire:Off
  Disable auto-acquire.
  
AutoAcquire:?
  Returns the current state of the auto-acquire function ("AutoAcquire:On" or "AutoAcquire:Off")


Range:<range>
  Sets the current range to the target in meters (example: "Range:1205.54")

Range:?
  Returns the last measured range (example: "Range:1205.54" or "Range:Unknown")


TargetGen:On
  Enable target generator

TargetGen:Off
  Disable target generator

TargetGen:<select> <type> <color> <position x> <position y> <size x> <size y>
  Controls the operation of the target generator.  The parameters are defined as follows:
  <select> can be Background, Target1 or Target2
  <type> can be Off/Disabled, Rectangle or Diamond (NOTE: background must use Rectangle)
  <color> is an integer grayscale value from 0 to 1023
  <position x> is the pixel location of the center of the target
  <position y> is the line location of the center of the target
  <size x> is the size in pixels of the target
  <size y> is the size in lines of the target


GPS:?
  Returns the current position with altitude, date and time of the attached IRIG/GPS unit.
  The output is in the format "GPS:<sync status>:<latitude> <longitude> <altitude>:<date>:<time>"
  where the parameters are defined as follows:
  <sync status> can be N (not synced) or S (synced)
  <latitude> is in degrees, minutes and seconds with milliseconds
  <longitude> is in degrees, minutes and seconds with milliseconds
  <altitude> is in meters above geoid
  <date> is in the format year-month-day
  <time> is in the format hour.minute.second.milliseconds UTC
  (example: "GPS:S:N035 49'01.645" W117 35'34.812" 762.29m:2012-07-06:14.09.43.697")


MisLevel:On <phi angle> <theta angle>
  Enable mislevel correction to the mount angles and set the phi and theta
  angles for the correction (if specified)
  
MisLevel:Off
  Disable mislevel correction to the mount angles
  
MisLevel:?
  Returns the current mislevel status along with the current phi and theta angles
  (example: "MisLevel:On 0.567845 1.89776")
